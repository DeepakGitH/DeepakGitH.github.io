	<h1>The Refinery of Data</h1>
	<p>If data is the new oil. Data Science is the new refinery. True value of data can only be captured if it is collected, properly pipelined,
	cleaned and curated and then used for insight and inference using math and busines context. Organizations which understand this well
	and spend time and effort building this correctly see remarkedly different value then organizations which just do lip service to the value of
	data. 
		Doing this right is incredibly hard. While the hype of data science has helped it leap frog in terms of technology and science it has also
	hurt it where organizations just think that hiring a few data scientists and purchasing a few software tools will help them become data driven
	and insights will pour in. And when this does not happen they become disillusioned with the science. I am interesting in discussions on making
	data science valuable.<a href="/about">More details on my background...</a></p>
