	<h1>Data Products: Power and Challenges</h1>
	<p>If data is the new oil. Data Science is the new refinery. True value of data can only be captured if it is collected, properly pipelined,
	cleaned and curated and then presented in a way to make business sense leading to better decision making. As a data scientist, I believe in building 
	data products which enable complex decision making. Good data products are tools which allow business owners with little experience in data analysis 
	to connect business understanding with their data. I am interested in discussions around data products, building complex ML pipelines, deploying ML
	products, ML at scale and more focused around building machine learning based products.
